# Question Bank

> Curated questions organized by phase. These are ready to use — pull directly from this bank during the discovery process. Do not ask them all. Pick the question that fits the moment. The best question is the one that follows naturally from what the user just said.

## Soul Questions (Phase 1)

Open-ended, feeling-first. These are designed to bypass the visual and go straight to the emotional. Do not ask about colors, fonts, or layouts in this phase.

### Primary Questions

Start with one of these. They are the widest doors into the soul.

- "What should someone feel when they use this?"
- "If this project were a physical place, what place would it be?"
- "What's the one word you want people to think of?"
- "Name something you find beautiful that isn't a website or app."
- "What feeling do you want to avoid? What should this never feel like?"

### Deepening Questions

Use these after the user has answered 1-2 primary questions. They dig into the specifics of what the user has already shared.

- "Is there a memory or moment that has the energy you want this project to have?"
- "If this project had a voice, whose voice would it be?"
- "You said [their word]. Tell me more about what that means to you."
- "When you imagine someone using this for the first time, what's the look on their face?"
- "What's the opposite of what you want? What would make you wince?"
- "If someone described this project to a friend, what adjective would you want them to use?"
- "Is there a piece of music that has the feeling you're going for?"
- "What's the difference between what you want and 'minimalist'?" (if they lean toward restraint)
- "What's the difference between what you want and 'fun'?" (if they lean toward energy)

### Clarifying Questions

Use these when the user gives a vague or surface-level answer. They help find the truth beneath the word.

- "When you say 'clean,' what does clean feel like to you?"
- "When you say 'modern,' what makes something feel modern versus just new?"
- "When you say 'professional,' is that the professionalism of a law firm or a design studio?"
- "What's an example of something that tries to be [their word] but gets it wrong?"
- "If you had to choose: would you rather it feel [quality A] or [quality B]?" (use two qualities from their answers that might be in tension)

## Eyes Questions (Phase 2)

Reference-gathering. These help the user surface visual inspirations and articulate what they respond to.

### Gathering References

- "Show me a website or app you think is beautiful."
- "Share a URL of a website or app whose visual style resonates with you — I'll analyze it."
- "Do you have any screenshots or moodboard images you'd like me to look at? Share the file path."
- "Is there a brand — not necessarily a tech brand — whose aesthetic you admire?"
- "Is there a physical object, place, or material that has the feeling you described in Phase 1?"
- "Think of a book cover, album cover, or poster that has the right energy. What is it?"
- "Is there a space — a room, a building, a landscape — that feels the way you want this to feel?"
- "If you could pull a screenshot from any app on your phone right now, which app has the closest vibe?"

### Analyzing References

Ask both of these for every reference the user provides.

- "What do you love about this?"
- "What would you change about this?"
- "I notice [observation about the referenced site/image]. Does that resonate with the feeling we described?"

### Pattern Recognition

Use these after the user has shared 3-4 references.

- "I'm noticing a pattern: [observation]. Does that feel right?"
- "Your references share [quality]. Is that important to you, or is it coincidence?"
- "None of your references have [quality]. Is that a deliberate avoidance?"
- "If I had to pick the single most important thing your references share, I'd say [quality]. Is that your north star visually?"
- "Across these references, I see a pattern of [common theme]. Is that intentional?"

### Claude's Suggestions

After understanding the direction, suggest references of your own. Frame them like this:

- "Based on what you've described, let me find some examples that might match..." (Claude-initiated)
- "Based on what you've described, I think [reference] might resonate. It has [quality from the soul]. What do you think?"
- "Here's something that takes [their preferred quality] in a different direction: [reference]. Does this go too far, or does it open something up?"
- "This is the opposite of what you've shown me: [contrasting reference]. What specifically makes this wrong for you?" (Negative references can be as clarifying as positive ones.)

## Dimension Questions (Phase 3)

One set per dimension. These are formatted for direct use — present the dimension, then ask with the positions as options.

### Tone

"Every interface has a personality, even if it's trying not to. What personality should yours have?"

Options:
- **Quiet confidence** — restrained, generous, unhurried. The interface simply is.
- **Warm invitation** — friendly, open, approachable. It says "come in."
- **Professional authority** — structured, clear, competent. It communicates mastery.
- **Playful energy** — bold, expressive, vibrant. It has personality and shows it.

Follow-up: "Why does that feel right for this project?"

### Color

"Where does your project fall on the color spectrum?"

Options:
- **Monochrome** — black, white, and gray. All hierarchy from value, not hue.
- **Muted earth** — warm, desaturated. Ochre, sage, clay, stone.
- **Bold primary** — a few vivid, confident colors used decisively.
- **Pastel and soft** — light, gentle, airy. Color that whispers.

Follow-up: "How many colors feel right? Just one or two, or a fuller palette?"

### Typography

"If your interface had a voice, what kind of voice would it be?"

Options:
- **Code voice** — monospace, honest, even. Precise and unpretentious.
- **Editorial** — serif, elegant, authoritative. Like a well-edited publication.
- **Swiss** — sans-serif, clean, geometric. Modern and transparent.
- **Handwritten** — organic, personal, warm. Human and imperfect.

Follow-up: "Should the type be one voice for everything, or different voices for different roles (headings vs. body)?"

### Space

"How much room should things have?"

Options:
- **Generous** — lots of breathing room, like a gallery. Each element has space to itself.
- **Balanced** — comfortable, conventional. Not cramped, not sparse.
- **Dense** — information-rich, compact. Everything within reach.
- **Asymmetric** — dynamic, editorial. Space distributed unevenly for visual interest.

Follow-up: "When you see a page with lots of empty space, does it feel calm or wasteful?"

### Shape

"What shape should your elements have?"

Options:
- **Square and bordered** — direct, structural. Sharp corners, thin borders, flat.
- **Rounded and soft** — friendly, approachable. Medium to large radius, gentle.
- **Borderless and open** — floating, modern. Defined by space, not lines.
- **Complex and ornamental** — rich, detailed. Decorative elements, varied corners.

Follow-up: "Should there be visible borders between things, or should space alone do the separation?"

### Motion

"How should your interface handle movement?"

Options:
- **Still** — confident through stillness. State changes are instant. Nothing performs.
- **Selective** — life only where something is truly alive. The frame stays still.
- **Fluid** — smooth transitions, continuous experience. Motion as connective tissue.
- **Playful** — bouncy, joyful. Elements have personality through how they move.

Follow-up: "When a button is clicked, should anything happen visually? Or should it just do its job?"

### Image

"How should images feel within your interface?"

Options:
- **B&W tethered** — grayscale, anchored, part of the tonal world. No floating.
- **Full color natural** — vibrant, present, unfiltered. The image is the star.
- **Illustrated** — stylized, branded, controlled. Consistent illustration style.
- **Abstract** — textural, atmospheric. Mood over subject.

Follow-up: "Should images have borders or frames, or should they feel unbounded?"

## Token Feedback Questions (Phase 4)

Use these when presenting concrete token values to the user. One question per token group.

### Color Tokens

- "Does this palette feel like the soul we wrote?"
- "Are there too many colors? Too few?"
- "Is the primary color strong enough? Too strong?"
- "Does the background feel right? Too white? Too warm? Too cool?"
- "Is there enough contrast between the heading text and the body text?"
- "Are there too many grays? Not enough?"

### Typography Tokens

- "Does this font feel right for the voice we described?"
- "Is the body text size comfortable to read?"
- "Is the heading size dramatic enough? Too dramatic?"
- "Does the line-height feel right? Too tight? Too loose?"
- "Is there enough difference between the heading weight and the body weight?"

### Spacing Tokens

- "Does this spacing feel too tight? Too loose? Just right?"
- "Does the card feel cramped inside, or does it have enough room?"
- "Is there enough distance between sections, or do they bleed into each other?"
- "Does the button padding feel balanced?"

### Shape Tokens

- "Do these corners feel right? Should they be sharper? Rounder?"
- "Is the border too visible? Not visible enough?"
- "Does the card feel like it has the right physical character?"
- "If you could pick up this button, how would it feel in your hand?" (A playful question that reveals a lot about shape expectations.)

### Motion Tokens

- "Does this animation speed feel right? Too fast? Too slow?"
- "Is there enough motion here, or should more things move?"
- "Is there too much motion? Should some things be still?"
- "Does the easing feel natural or mechanical?"

---

## Validation Questions (Phase 5)

Use these when presenting generated components to the user.

### Per-Component

- "Does this feel right?"
- "Does this button feel like it belongs to this project?"
- "What's wrong about this card? What feels off?"
- "If you saw this on a website, would you think 'this is [one-word from Phase 1]'?"
- "What would you change about this? Be specific."
- "Is this too much? Too little? What's missing?"

### Comparing Components

- "Does this feel like the same family as the last component?"
- "If these two components were on the same page, would they feel like they belong together?"
- "Which of the components we've approved so far is your favorite? Why?"
- "Which feels the least right? What's the gap?"

### Final Feeling Test

After all components are approved:

- "Look at all five together. Do they feel like they belong to the same family?"
- "Do they feel like the soul we wrote?"
- "If someone saw these components with no context, what one word would they use to describe the style?"
- "Is that the word you want?"

## Meta Questions

These do not belong to a specific phase. Use them when the process needs recalibrating.

- "Are we going in the right direction?"
- "Is there anything we haven't talked about that feels important?"
- "On a scale from 'we're close' to 'we need to start over,' where are we?"
- "What are you most excited about so far?"
- "What are you most unsure about?"
