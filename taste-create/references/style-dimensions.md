# Style Dimensions

> The 7 axes of visual taste. Each dimension is a spectrum with named positions. During Phase 3 of the discovery process, walk through each dimension one at a time, ask the user where they fall, and record the position with rationale. Every position maps to concrete tokens in Phase 4.

---

## How to Use This File

During Phase 3, present one dimension at a time. For each:

1. Name the dimension and explain what it governs in one sentence
2. Present the positions as options (these are not exhaustive — the user can land between positions or describe a hybrid)
3. Ask where they fall
4. Ask why — the rationale connects the position to the soul
5. Note how this will map to tokens (so the user knows what they are deciding)

Do not present all 7 at once. One at a time. Let each one breathe.

---

## 1. Tone

> The emotional temperature of the entire interface. Tone is the most abstract dimension — it does not map to a single token group but modifies *all* of them. It is the closest dimension to the soul, which is why it comes first.

### Spectrum

Formal ... casual | Warm ... cool | Confident ... humble | Loud ... quiet

### Positions

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Quiet confidence** | Restrained, generous, unhurried. The interface does not announce itself — it simply is. Hierarchy is clear but never loud. There is space to breathe. This is the tone of a well-set table: everything in its place, nothing calling for attention. |
| **Warm invitation** | Friendly, open, approachable. The interface says "come in" without being overbearing. It smiles without performing. There is personality here, but it does not dominate. Like a host who makes you feel at home without making a show of it. |
| **Professional authority** | Structured, clear, competent. The interface communicates mastery and reliability. It is not cold — it is precise. Like a well-run meeting: everything has a purpose, nothing wastes time, and you trust the person running it. |
| **Playful energy** | Bold, expressive, vibrant. The interface has personality and is not afraid to show it. Things pop, things bounce, things surprise. There is joy here — not chaos, but controlled exuberance. Like a well-designed toy: delightful but purposeful. |

### Maps To

Tone does not map to a single token group. Instead, it acts as a modifier across all dimensions:
- Quiet confidence: narrow color palette, generous spacing, minimal motion, restrained shape
- Warm invitation: warm colors, comfortable spacing, selective motion, soft shapes
- Professional authority: neutral colors, structured spacing, minimal motion, clean shapes
- Playful energy: bold colors, dynamic spacing, expressive motion, varied shapes

### Example Question

"Every interface has a personality, even if it's trying not to. What personality should yours have? Should it feel like quiet confidence — restrained and generous? A warm invitation — friendly and open? Professional authority — structured and clear? Or playful energy — bold and expressive?"

## 2. Color

> The chromatic identity of the interface. Color is the most immediately visible dimension — people notice palette before typography, shape, or space. The position here determines not just which colors, but how many and how they are used.

### Spectrum

Warm ... cool | Saturated ... muted | Monochrome ... polychrome | Dark ... light

### Positions

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Monochrome** | One hue (or no hue — pure black/white/gray). All hierarchy comes from value (lightness/darkness) and typography, never from chromatic contrast. This is the most restrained position. It says: color is noise, and we are choosing silence. |
| **Muted earth** | Warm, desaturated tones — ochre, sage, clay, stone, cream. The palette feels natural and grounded, like materials rather than pigments. There may be 3-5 colors, but they all feel like they came from the same landscape. |
| **Bold primary** | Saturated, confident colors used decisively. Not many colors — perhaps 2-3 — but the ones present are vivid and intentional. Think of a flag: a few colors, used at scale, instantly recognizable. |
| **Pastel and soft** | Light, desaturated, airy. The palette feels gentle and approachable. Colors are present but never loud. Think of morning light through curtains — color is there, but it whispers. |

### Maps To

- **Color palette:** number of colors, hue range, saturation levels
- **Accent strategy:** whether accents exist, how many, how vivid
- **Functional colors:** how error/success/warning states are expressed within the palette constraints
- **Dark mode approach:** inversion strategy depends on the base palette

### Example Question

"Where does your project fall on the color spectrum? Should it be monochrome — all hierarchy from black, white, and gray? Muted earth tones — warm, natural, grounded? Bold primary colors — a few vivid, confident hues? Or pastel and soft — gentle, airy, whispering?"

## 3. Typography

> The voice of the interface. Typography is how the interface speaks — not what it says, but how it sounds in the reader's mind. A serif font reads differently than a monospace font, the way a handwritten letter reads differently than a typed one.

### Spectrum

Serif ... sans ... mono | Tight ... loose | Loud ... quiet | Expressive ... neutral

### Positions

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Code voice** | Monospace, even, quiet. Every character takes the same space. The voice is honest and unpretentious — it does not perform or decorate. Hierarchy comes from size and weight alone. This is the voice of someone who writes code: precise, clear, no flourish. |
| **Editorial** | Serif, elegant, varied. The voice has authority and history — it recalls newspapers, books, magazines. There is a range of expression: bold headlines, graceful body text, delicate captions. This is the voice of a well-edited publication. |
| **Swiss** | Sans-serif, clean, geometric. The voice is modern and neutral — it does not call attention to itself. Helvetica energy. The type is a transparent medium: you read through it to the content. Hierarchy is clear but effortless. |
| **Handwritten** | Organic, personal, imperfect. The voice has warmth and individuality — it feels like someone made this by hand. Not every character is perfect, and that is the point. This is the voice of a letter from a friend: human, warm, specific. |

### Maps To

- **Font family:** primary typeface (or typefaces, if the position calls for pairing)
- **Size scale:** how dramatic the size range is (editorial tends toward wider range, code voice toward narrower)
- **Weight range:** how many weights are used (expressive positions use more, neutral positions use fewer)
- **Line-height:** tighter for dense/editorial, looser for generous/code

### Example Question

"If your interface had a voice, what kind of voice would it be? A code voice — monospace, honest, even? An editorial voice — serif, elegant, authoritative? A Swiss voice — sans-serif, clean, modern? Or a handwritten voice — organic, personal, warm?"

---

## 4. Space

> How much room things have. Space is generosity made visible — or density made functional. The position here determines whether the interface breathes or packs, whether it whispers or shouts through proximity.

### Spectrum

Dense ... open | Gridded ... organic | Symmetric ... asymmetric

### Positions

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Generous** | Lots of breathing room. Elements are never crowded. Padding is liberal, margins are wide, sections have clear separation through empty space. This communicates calm, respect, and unhurried-ness. Like a gallery: each piece has a wall to itself. |
| **Balanced** | Comfortable, conventional spacing. Not cramped, not sparse — the Goldilocks zone. Things have enough room to be clear without wasting screen real estate. This is the default of most well-designed interfaces. |
| **Dense** | Information-rich, compact, efficient. Space is valuable and used carefully. Many elements visible at once. Padding is tight, margins are minimal. This communicates utility and power. Like a cockpit: everything within reach. |
| **Asymmetric** | Editorial, dynamic, intentional tension. Space is distributed unevenly — some areas are generous, others are tight. This creates visual interest and guides the eye. Like a magazine spread: the layout itself is a design element. |

### Maps To

- **Spacing scale:** base unit and multiplier (generous = larger base, dense = smaller base)
- **Grid structure:** number of columns, gutter width, content area width
- **Content width:** maximum line length for readability
- **Section rhythm:** vertical distance between major content blocks

### Example Question

"How much room should things have? Should the interface feel generous — lots of breathing room, like a gallery? Balanced — comfortable, conventional? Dense — information-rich, compact, like a dashboard? Or asymmetric — dynamic, editorial, with intentional variation?"

## 5. Shape

> The physical character of elements. Shape determines whether the interface feels soft or sharp, heavy or light, bounded or free. Every button, card, input, and container is defined by its shape language.

### Spectrum

Round ... sharp | Simple ... complex | Heavy ... light | Bordered ... borderless

### Positions

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Square and bordered** | Direct, structural, honest. Corners are sharp (zero or near-zero radius). Elements are defined by thin borders. There is no pretense at depth — everything exists on a flat, honest plane. This communicates directness and clarity. |
| **Rounded and soft** | Friendly, approachable, gentle. Corners are rounded (medium to large radius). Elements feel touchable and safe. Borders may be softer or absent, replaced by subtle background fills. This communicates warmth and accessibility. |
| **Borderless and open** | Floating, modern, spacious. Elements are defined by space and background color rather than borders. Corners may be slightly rounded but borders are absent or extremely subtle. This communicates openness and lightness. |
| **Complex and ornamental** | Rich, detailed, crafted. Elements may have decorative borders, patterns, or textures. Corners may vary. There is visual richness in the details. This communicates craft, luxury, or historical weight. |

### Maps To

- **Border-radius:** 0px (square) to large values (rounded) or mixed (complex)
- **Border-width:** 1px (defined), 0px (borderless), or varied (complex)
- **Shadow:** none (flat) to subtle (elevated) to pronounced (layered)
- **Decoration:** minimal (square/borderless) to rich (ornamental)

### Example Question

"What shape should your elements have? Square and bordered — direct, structural, with clean edges? Rounded and soft — friendly, approachable, touchable? Borderless and open — defined by space rather than lines? Or complex and ornamental — rich, detailed, crafted?"

## 6. Motion

> Where life lives — and where stillness serves. Motion is not just about whether things move, but about the philosophy of movement. Some interfaces believe everything should flow. Others believe stillness is confidence. The position here determines the animation strategy.

### Spectrum

Playful ... restrained | Everywhere ... selective ... nowhere | Fast ... slow

### Positions

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Still** | No animation, or nearly none. Confidence through stillness. State changes are instant. If something appears, it appears. If something changes, it changes. The interface does not perform — it simply is. Motion exists only where functional necessity demands it (loading indicators). |
| **Selective** | Animation only where it is alive. Illustrations may breathe. Data may dance. But the frame — buttons, modals, navigation — stays still. Motion is earned: an element must justify its movement. This position separates the living (graphical) from the structural (UI chrome). |
| **Fluid** | Smooth transitions on most interactions. Pages crossfade. Elements ease in and out. The interface feels like a continuous experience rather than a series of states. Motion is a connective tissue. But it is never theatrical — always purposeful and calm. |
| **Playful** | Bouncy, joyful, everywhere. Elements have personality through motion — buttons bounce on click, cards lift on hover, pages slide in with spring physics. The motion is part of the brand. It is controlled chaos: delightful but not disorienting. |

### Maps To

- **Easing curve:** linear (mechanical) to spring (playful)
- **Duration scale:** short (fast, decisive) to long (slow, luxurious)
- **Animation scope:** which elements animate (none / graphical only / interactive / everything)
- **Transition strategy:** instant state changes vs. animated transitions

### Example Question

"How should your interface handle movement? Should it be still — confident through stillness, instant state changes? Selective — life only where something is truly alive, the frame stays still? Fluid — smooth transitions, continuous experience? Or playful — bouncy, joyful, personality through motion?"

## 7. Image

> How imagery is treated within the interface. Not what images to use, but how they are rendered, positioned, and integrated with the rest of the design. The image dimension defines the relationship between photography/illustration and the UI around it.

### Spectrum

Color ... B&W | Floating ... grounded | Photo ... illustration ... abstract | Treated ... raw

### Positions

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **B&W tethered** | Grayscale, anchored, honest. Images are converted to black and white to join the interface's tonal range. They are visually anchored — inside bordered containers, flush to edges, sitting on surfaces. No floating, no shadows, no pretense. The image belongs to the page. |
| **Full color natural** | Vibrant, present, unfiltered. Images retain their natural color and are displayed with minimal treatment. They are the loudest visual element on the page, and the UI defers to them. Sizing is generous, cropping is respectful. The image is the content. |
| **Illustrated** | Stylized, branded, controlled. Imagery is illustration rather than (or in addition to) photography. The illustration style is part of the brand — consistent line weight, consistent palette, consistent character. This gives total control over visual tone. |
| **Abstract** | Textural, atmospheric, suggestive. Images are not representational — they are patterns, textures, gradients, or generative visuals. They create mood rather than depict subjects. The imagery serves as background or accent, not as primary content. |

### Maps To

- **Image filter:** none (natural) / grayscale (B&W) / duotone / custom treatment
- **Positioning strategy:** tethered (anchored to containers/edges) / floating (centered in space) / background (full-bleed behind content)
- **Border treatment:** bordered containers / borderless / bleed edges
- **Aspect ratio handling:** fixed ratios / natural ratios / art-directed per image

### Example Question

"How should images feel within your interface? B&W and tethered — grayscale, anchored, part of the monochrome world? Full color and natural — vibrant, present, the images are the star? Illustrated — stylized, branded, controlled? Or abstract — textural, atmospheric, mood over subject?"

## Combining Dimensions

After all 7 dimensions are positioned, read them back as a cohesive profile. The combination should feel coherent — not every position combination makes sense, and part of your job is to identify tensions.

**If two dimensions conflict:**
- Name the tension: "You chose playful motion but quiet confidence for tone — those pull in different directions."
- Ask the user which one wins: "Which is more important to you? The playfulness or the quiet?"
- Adjust the conflicting dimension to resolve the tension

**Common coherent combinations:**

| Soul | Typical Dimensions |
|------|--------------------|
| Quiet, honest, restrained | Monochrome, code voice, generous, square, still, B&W tethered, quiet confidence |
| Warm, inviting, personal | Muted earth, handwritten or editorial, balanced, rounded, selective, full color, warm invitation |
| Professional, trustworthy, clear | Bold primary (limited), Swiss, balanced, borderless, fluid, full color natural, professional authority |
| Playful, expressive, bold | Bold primary, Swiss or handwritten, asymmetric, rounded, playful, illustrated, playful energy |

These are patterns, not prescriptions. A user may combine quiet confidence tone with bold primary colors — and that could be exactly right for their project. The soul is the tiebreaker, not the combinations table.
